    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Strawberry pie is a delightful dessert made primarily with fresh
      strawberries and sugar, nestled in a flaky pie crust. Sometimes, a touch
      of gelatin is added. It's often served with a dollop of whipped cream.

      <li>400g Wheat flour</li>
      <li>200g Butter</li>
      <li>100g Sugar</li>
      <li>A bit of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Filling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>400g Strawberries</li>
      <li>100g Sugar</li>
      <li>A slice of lemon</li>
      <li>A bit of maize starch powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

      <p>
        <li>
          In a container place the wheat flour, margarine, sugar and a pinch of
          salt. Mix everything until the dough is crumbly.
        </li>
      </p>

          For the filling, place the strawberries in a pan over high heat and
          wait for it to melt until the strawberries are soft enough to mash.
          Once you mash the strawberries, add the sugar and a slice of lemon, to
          help thicken the filling, make a mixture of cornstarch with a little
          water and add it to the filling.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          After finishing the filling, place the dough on a table with plastic
          wrap or a counter to roll out the dough, divide the dough in half into
          a smaller and a larger part, open the larger part and place it at the
          bottom of the pan. Use a fork to make holes in the bottom of the dough
          to avoid creating bubbles and place the dough to preheat for 10
          minutes.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          After preheating the dough, remove it from the oven and add the
          filling to the pan. Open the smaller part of the dough and leave it in
          the shape of the mold, place this dough on top of the filling and bake
          at 180°C for 30 minutes. If desired, after removing the pie from the
          oven, use a sieve to pour sugar over the top of the pie.
