        <p>
          Strawberry pie is a delightful dessert made primarily with fresh
          strawberries and sugar, nestled in a flaky pie crust. Sometimes, a
          touch of gelatin is added. It's often served with a dollop of whipped
          cream.

          <p>
            <li>
              In a container place the wheat flour, margarine, sugar and a pinch
              of salt. Mix everything until the dough is crumbly. >
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              For the filling, place the strawberries in a pan over high heat
              and wait for it to melt until the strawberries are soft enough to
              mash. Once you mash the strawberries, add the sugar and a slice of
              lemon, to help thicken the filling, make a mixture of cornstarch
              with a little water and add it to the filling.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              After finishing the filling, place the dough on a table with
              plastic wrap or a counter to roll out the dough, divide the dough
              in half into a smaller and a larger part, open the larger part and
              place it at the bottom of the pan. Use a fork to make holes in the
              bottom of the dough to avoid creating bubbles and place the dough
              to preheat for 10 minutes. >
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              After preheating the dough, remove it from the oven and add the
              filling to the pan. Open the smaller part of the dough and leave
              it in the shape of the mold, place this dough on top of the
              filling and bake at 180Â°C for 30 minutes. If desired, after
              removing the pie from the oven, use a sieve to pour sugar over the
              top of the pie.
