      <p>
        <li>
          After mixing everything, turn off the heat and pour the syrup into the
          pudding mold and then add the dough, gently and slowly, as the dough
          cannot mix with the syrup, it is necessary to do the process in that
          order, so that at the time After un-molding, the syrup stays on top of
          the pudding.
        </li>

        <li>
          Then, cover the pan with aluminum foil and place the pan in a water
          bath in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for 40 minutes. Note: The time will
          depend on the power of your oven, I recommend that you add hot water
          when placing it in the water bath speed up the process.
