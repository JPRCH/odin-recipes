    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Condensed milk pudding, also known as caramel pudding or creme caramel, is
      a delectable dessert enjoyed worldwide for its silky-smooth texture and
      rich sweetness. This classic dessert typically consists of a layer of
      caramelized sugar at the base, topped with a velvety custard mixture made
      from eggs, milk (full-fat for the best flavor), condensed milk, vanilla
      extract, and sometimes flour. The custard can be baked or steamed to
      perfection, creating a delightful sweet treat with a perfect balance of
      sweetness and creaminess. Condensed milk plays a key role in enhancing the
      richness and sweetness of the pudding, making it a favorite for those with
      a sweet tooth. This dessert is often served chilled and can be garnished
      with caramel sauce, powdered sugar, vanilla ice cream, or whipped cream
      for an extra touch of indulgence. Enjoyed by many, condensed milk pudding
      is a timeless and comforting dessert that brings joy and nostalgia with
      every spoonful.
