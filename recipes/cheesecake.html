    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Strawberry cheesecake is a delightful dessert that combines the richness
      of cheesecake with the vibrant sweetness of strawberries. This classic
      dessert typically features a creamy and light cheesecake base, often made
      with cream cheese, sugar, eggs, sour cream, and vanilla extract, poured
      over a graham cracker crust. The highlight of a strawberry cheesecake is
      the luscious strawberry topping, which can vary from fresh strawberry
      slices to a strawberry sauce or puree. The strawberries can be
      incorporated into the filling or used as a garnish, adding a burst of
      fruity flavor to each bite. Whether baked or no-bake, strawberry
      cheesecake is a popular treat enjoyed for its perfect balance of creamy,
      tangy, and sweet flavors, making it a favorite for dessert lovers seeking
      a refreshing and indulgent treat.

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        <li>
          Grind the cornstarch biscuit until it resembles crumbs and separate it
          into a container. Melt the margarine in the microwave and then pour it
          over the cornstarch biscuits, mix everything until the dough stops
          sticking to your hands.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Separate the cream cheese, condensed milk and cream inside the
          blender. Place 5 tablespoons of water in a pan and add the unflavored
          gelatin, stir until it boils and throw it into the blender with the
          other ingredients. To enhance the flavor, also add a pinch of salt to
          the filling.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Place the cornstarch cookie dough in a mold with a removable bottom,
          mold the dough into the shape of the mold and pour the finished
          filling on top, place the mold in the refrigerator and let it cool for
          about an hour.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          For the topping, place the frozen strawberries in a pan and wait for
          it to melt until the strawberries are soft enough to mash. After
          mashing all the strawberries, add sugar and half a lemon. To thicken
          the icing, make a mixture of cornstarch with a little water, add it to
          the icing and mix well. Once the topping is ready, place it in another
          container with a lid and leave it in the fridge until it cools.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Once everything is well cooled, remove it from the fridge and pour the
          topping over the filling, remove the sides of the removable bottom
          mold and that's it!
